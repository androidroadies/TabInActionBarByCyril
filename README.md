[Mirko Dimartino](https://www.google.com/+MirkoDimartino_Mirkoddd) has made a library as [Tab Bar View](https://github.com/Mirkoddd/TabBarView). It's awesome and please check it out.

Shameless Plug : My attempt similar to this action is made with [PagerSlidingTabStrip](https://github.com/astuetz/PagerSlidingTabStrip) is [TabInAB](https://github.com/yelinaung/TabInAB).
